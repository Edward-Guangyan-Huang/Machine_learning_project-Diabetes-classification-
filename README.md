# Machine_learning_project-Diabetes-classification-
This is an entry-level machine=learning project in which different algorithms of machine learning are used to construct models that helps predicting 
whether a patient is diabetic using a series of health index. Data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization are also adopted in this project.
